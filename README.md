# NETMOUNTAINSÂ® Curated IPv4 Blocklist
This is a curated and actively monitored IPv4 Blocklist which is generated every 30 minutes based on the following engines:

- Combinator: Downloading and combining of various publicly available blocklists
- ASN-Blocker: Adding IPs from ASN with a very bad reputation
- Honeypot: Adding IPs which are detected by IDS/IPS systems in our datacenters
- FP-Filter: Removing false-positives using a list of good-known ASN IP-Ranges from major companies
- Whitelists: Removing false-positives reported to our datacenter team (datacenter@netmountains.de)

The list is actively monitored for daily adds/removes by our datacenter team.
If your ASN or IP is part of this range and you want to know about the reason just mail us.

You can use this list as-is without any warranty. We aren't responsible for any damage by using this list.
